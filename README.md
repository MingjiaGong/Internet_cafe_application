# E Jump Start Internet Café Application

## Overview
The E Jump Start Internet Café App is designed to transform the traditional internet café experience into a user-centric, modern service. This app streamlines the process of using internet café services by simplifying sign-in, sign-out, and payment operations, offering a seamless user experience.

## Motivation
This project was conceived to address the complexities and inconveniences faced by users at traditional internet cafés, particularly in managing time and handling payments. My solution is an easy-to-use app that removes these barriers, attracting more users and helping café owners to run a more efficient business.

## Purpose
The aim is to provide a hassle-free system that allows users to quickly sign in, use the services, and sign out, complete with an integrated payment gateway for ease of use and efficiency.

## Potential Users
- Individual Users
- Students
- Gamers
- Internet Café Owners

## Related Work
Our app stands out by offering a mobile platform that is user-friendly and designed with a modern interface, differing from desktop-based counterparts like CyberCafePro, Antamedia, and MyCyberCafe.

## Requirement Analysis and Testing
We've incorporated features like user registration, simple sign-in/out, café location overview, in-app wallet credit, and more, ensuring each component is thoroughly tested and user-friendly.

## Design and Implementation
The app's architecture uses Jetpack Compose for the frontend, Kotlin for Android development, Java with Spring Boot for backend APIs, and MongoDB for the database. I prioritize a user-friendly mobile platform with modern UI/UX design principles.

## Project Structure
The project is structured with a clear separation between the frontend (Android app with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose) and the backend (Java with Spring Boot), ensuring maintainability and scalability.

## Timeline
The project development is divided into iterations focusing on essential, desirable, and optional requirements, ensuring a robust and feature-rich application.
